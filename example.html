<!--
To use qdcrumbs in a jinja2 template, the url can be accessed through
breadcrumb.url and the name of the page that the url points to can be
accessed through breadcrumb.text

Breadcrumbs can have any name, but the attributes must be accessed via
".url" and ".text".

Below is a simple example to add classic style breadcrumbs.
-->
<div>
    <!--
        Include a static link to the site root (Index.html)
        (The Application's root must be added manually)
    -->
    <a href="{{ url_for('index.html')}}">Index</a>

    <!--Loop through the breadcrumbs to this resource-->
    {%- for breadcrumb in breadcrumbs -%}
        <a href="{{ breadcrumb.url }}"> / {{ breadcrumb.text }}</a>
    {%- endfor -%}

</div>
